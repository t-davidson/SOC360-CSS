    "paragraph": "in the end, it's our ideals, our values that built america, values that allowed us to forge a nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the globe, values that drive our citizens still. every day, americans meet their responsibilities to their families and their employers. time and again, they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country. they take pride in their labor and are generous in spirit. these aren't republican values or democratic values that they're living by, business values or labor values, they're american values."

    "paragraph": "yet communist tactics against the free nations have shifted in emphasis from reliance on violence and the threat of violence to reliance on division, enticement and duplicity. we must be well prepared to meet the current tactics which pose a dangerous though less obvious threat. at the same time, our policy must be dynamic as well as flexible, designed primarily to forward the achievement of our own objectives rather than to meet each shift and change on the communist front. we must act in the firm assurance that the fruits of freedom are more attractive and desirable to mankind in the pursuit of happiness than the record of communism."

    "paragraph": "i think it is clear to every american, including every member of congress of both parties, that the confidence of the people who pay our bills in our institutions in washington is not high. we must restore it. we must begin again to make government work for ordinary taxpayers, not simply for organized interest groups. and that beginning must start with real political reform. i am asking the united states congress to pass a real campaign finance reform bill this year. i ask you to increase the participation of the american people by passing the motor voter bill promptly. i ask you to deal with the undue influence of special interests by passing a bill to end the tax deduction for lobbying and to act quickly to require all the people who lobby you to register as lobbyists by passing the lobbying registration bill."

    "paragraph": "we must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending, or entitlements. this year, the first of about 78 million baby boomers turn 60, including two of my dad's favorite people-;me and president clinton. [laughter] this milestone is more than a personal crisis-;[laughter]-; it is a national challenge. the retirement of the baby boom generation will put unprecedented strains on the federal government. by 2030, spending for social security, medicare, and medicaid alone will be almost 60 percent of the entire federal budget. and that will present future congresses with impossible choices: staggering tax increases, immense deficits, or deep cuts in every category of spending. congress did not act last year on my proposal to save social security, yet the rising cost of entitlements is a problem that is not going away. and every year we fail to act, the situation gets worse."
