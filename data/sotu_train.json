    "paragraph": "from one point of view it is not necessary to broach this fundamental matter. i do not doubt that the american people know what the war is about and what sort of an outcome they will regard as a realization of their purpose in it. as a nation we are united in spirit and intention. i pay little heed to those who tell me otherwise. i hear the voices of dissent; who does not? i hear the criticism and the clamor of the noisily thoughtless and troublesome. i also see men here and there fling themselves in impotent disloyalty against the calm, indomitable power of the nation. i hear men debate peace who understand neither its nature not the way in which we may attain it with uplifted eyes and unbroken spirits. but i know that none of these speaks for the nation. they do not touch the heart of anything. they may safely be left to strut their uneasy hour and be forgotten."

    "paragraph": "it may be the highest duty of a judge at any given moment to disregard, not merely the wishes of individuals of great political or financial power, but the overwhelming tide of public sentiment; and the judge who does thus disregard public sentiment when it is wrong, who brushes aside the plea of any special interest when the pleading is not rounded on righteousness, performs the highest service to the country. such a judge is deserving of all honor; and all honor can not be paid to this wise and fearless judge if we permit the growth of an absurd convention which would forbid any criticism of the judge of another type, who shows himself timid in the presence of arrogant disorder, or who on insufficient grounds grants an injunction that does grave injustice, or who in his capacity as a construer, and therefore in part a maker, of the law, in flagrant fashion thwarts the cause of decent government. the judge has a power over which no review can be exercised; he himself sits in review upon the acts of both the executive and legislative branches of the government; save in the most extraordinary cases he is amenable only at the bar of public opinion; and it is unwise to maintain that public opinion in reference to a man with such power shall neither be exprest nor led."
