# Plan
1. Course updates
2. Online experiments
3. Online surveys

# Course updates
- Homework 1 grades coming soon
- Homework 2 released on Wednesday
  - APIs and web-scraping
  
# Online experiments and surveys
## Adapting methods to the digital era
- Experiments and surveys are two mainstays of the social sciences
- Both were developed to study people in labs and in the field
- How does the internet and technological advancement create new opportunities for methodological innovation?

# Online experiments
## Motivation for online experiments
- Lab experiments provide control but little realism (*low external validity*)
  - e.g. Undergraduate students do not represent wider populations
- Field experiments provided realism but little control (*low internal validity*)
  - e.g. Many factors may affect internal validity
- Digital field experiments can provided both, at scale
  
# Online experiments
## Methods: Internal experiments
- Companies and other actors experiment internally
  - A/B tests used to test different user-interface and product differences
- The vast majority of these experiments are private, but some are published by researchers.
- Researchers recently made an entire archive of thousands of experiments available, see the \href{https://upworthy.natematias.com/}{Upworthy Research Archive}

<!--
# Online experiments
## The Emotional Contagion Study
- Opponents
  - Experimenting without clear consent
  - Emotional manipulation is creepy and potentially harmful
- Supporters
  - We give consent by accepting terms of service
  - FB is experimenting on us regardless, better we know about it
  - Manipulation and effects are tiny

<!--Lack of backlash. A positive cause (voting) and a positive outcome (increases). But what if it had suppressed turnout? 

There was little backlash against FB at the time, despite this demonstration of the power of the platform to influence political decisions, something we have paid more attention to since 2016

# Online experiments
## Methods: Using existing environments
- Researchers can use platforms to create their own experiments
  - e.g. Doleac and Stein (2013) used different pictures on Craigslist to measure discrimination
  - e.g. van de Rijt et al. (2014) randomly donated to Kickstarters, upvoted reviews, awarded Wikipedia contributers, and signed petitions to study the Matthew Effect
  - e.g. Munger (2017) used a Twitter "bot" to measure the effect of sanctions on racial harassment

# Online experiments
## Methods: Digital labs
- Create a virtual environment, fully controlled by the researcher
- High-cost (fixed costs associated with developing a platform)
- Zero variable cost experiments
  - Incentivizing participation

# Online experiments
## Ethics
- Digital experimentation forces us to pay more attention to ethics
- Salganik proposes the "three R's"
  - *Replace* experiments with less invasive methods, where possible.
  - *Refine* treatment to reduce potential harm.
  - *Reduce* number of participants as much as possible.

# Online surveys
## Three eras of survey sampling
- Area probability sampling
  - Face-to-face interviews
- Random digit dialling
  - Phone interviews
- Non-probability sampling
  - Online surveys
    - Linked "big data"
    
# Online surveys
## Issues with online sampling
- No sampling frame
- Non-representative populations
- Selection bias (i.e. opt-in surveys)
- Violations of IID assumption violations (e.g. snowball sampling)

# Online surveys

# Online surveys
## Working with non-probability samples
- Cheaper than fielding nationally-representative polls 
- But more difficult to work with than conventional survey  data
  - New statistical procedures and data sources non-probability sampling viable
    - Although MRP and other techniques have not been widely adopted by sociologists

<!-- Future: Consider including MRP demo -->

# Final thoughts
- New technologies and data sources allow us to reinvent existing methods
  - Innovative work combines social scientific approaches, statistics, and programming in new ways
- Digital experiments and surveys open up many opportunities for social scientific research
  - These methods come with more challenges and require different skills to conventional methods
  - We must think more about ethics, related to informed consent, impacts on study participants, and implications of partnerships with other organizations
  
# Next lecture
- Final projects discussion
- Introduction to RShiny
