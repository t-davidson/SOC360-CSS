# Plan
1. Course updates
2. Final projects
3. Developing Shiny applications in R

# Course updates
- Homework 2 released
  - Github Classroom link in Canvas Module
  - Topics: tidyverse + ggplot2, APIs, and webscraping
  - Deadline: Next Friday, 3/4, 5pm ET

# Final projects
## Goals
- Build an interactive data visualization app, focused on a topic of social scientific interest
- Showcase skills and knowledge developed in this class
- Add to your portfolio or resume

# Final projects
## Five steps
- Data collection
- Data cleaning
- Data analysis
- Data visualization
- Building and deploying an app

# Final projects
## Data collection
- Collect a dataset
  - Data of interest to social scientists
  - Data sources:
    - APIs
    - Webscraping
    - Existing datasets (e.g. General Social Survey, American National Election Study)

# Final projects
## Data cleaning
- Process dataset to extract relevant data
  - String pre-processing (more next week)
  - Parsing HTML
  - Merging datasets
  - Selecting, grouping, mutating, etc.
  
# Final projects
## Data analysis
- Conduct an analysis of the dataset. Possibilities include
  - Data summaries
  - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.)
  - Statistical tests (correlation, t-test, chi-squared, etc.)
  - Statistical modeling (regression, machine learning, topic modeling, etc.)

# Final projects
## Data visualization
- Construct visualizations of the dataset
  - Relationships between variables
  - Trends over time
  - Animations
  - Maps
- *All apps must have an interactive component*

# Final projects
## Building and deploying an app
- Use R Shiny to build an interactive app
- Deploy the app on the web using `Shinyapps.io`

# Final projects
## Final deliverables
1. A deployed Shiny app for interactive data visualization
2. An organized Github repository for the project
3. Documentation and a short written description of the app

# Final projects
## Milestones
1. Identify a suitable topic
  - *All projects are subject to approval*
2. Initial proposal (due 3/9)
  - A short description of the planned project including plan for data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization
3. Prototype (due 4/13)
  - A simple working prototype of your app
4. Presentation (5/2)
  - A chance to present your app
5. App and deliverables submitted (5/6 at 5pm)

# Final projects
## Feedback
- There will be several opportunities for formal and informal feedback
  - Office hours
  - Discussions with classmates
  - Feedback on proposal and prototype
  - Presentation
  
# Final projects
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="70%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/agile_workflow.png')
```
  
# Final projects
## Teamwork
- You can work on the project individually or as part of a team
- Make a decision when you submit your proposal
- Teams will be require to submit an additional document describing contributions of each member
  - Ensure fair distribution of work
  - Git commit history to highlight contributions

# Developing Shiny applications in R
## What is Shiny?
- Shiny is a package you can use to build interactive web pages directly from R
  - It does not require any experience with HTML, CSS, or Javascript, etc.
- Apps can be hosted on standalone webpages, enabling anyone to access them
- Many extensions available, making Shiny a powerful tool for data visualization and construction of dashboards.

# Developing Shiny applications in R
## Example 1: Explore your weather
- A \href{https://connect.rstudioservices.com/explore_your_weather}{simple app} to show trends in temperature and precipitation using data from NOAA

# Developing Shiny applications in R
## Example 1: Explore your weather
- This app visualizes an existing dataset containing information about average temperatures in a given location
- Features
  - Two different plots show temperature and precipitation
  - The user interface contains a search bar, return button, and a random city button
  - Options to change light/dark mode
  - Links to original data and code on Github

# Developing Shiny applications in R
## Example 2: Bloodbanks in India
- \href{https://opndt.shinyapps.io/bloodbank_india/}{This app} maps bloodbanks in India using data from the Open Government Platform
- Interactive, clickable map
- Tabs to show raw data and provide further details

# Developing Shiny applications in R
## More examples
- There are many more examples in the \href{https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/}{Gallery} on the Shiny website.

# Developing Shiny applications in R
## Extensions
- There are many extensions of the Shiny framework
  - \href{https://d3js.org/}{D3} for data-driven visualization. See \href{https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/articles/shiny.html}{`r2d3` website}
  - \href{https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/shiny.html}{Leaflet for interactive mapping}
  - \href{https://plotly-r.com/}{Plotly for interactive plots}
  - \href{https://github.com/cschwem2er/stminsights}{STMinsights} for exploring structural topic models (Week 9)
- \href{https://github.com/nanxstats/awesome-shiny-extensions}{This Github page} lists a ton of Shiny resources.

# Developing Shiny applications in R
## Further readings
- RStudio's \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/shiny.pdf}{Shiny cheatsheet} is a really useful quick reference.
- *\href{https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html}{Mastering Shiny}* by Hadley Wickham is available for free online.
- RStudio has a two and a half hour long \href{https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/}{video tutorial}, along with a set of short online tutorials
- Lots of videos on YouTube

# Developing Shiny applications in R
## Deployment
- Apps can be deployed for free using the \href{https://www.shinyapps.io/}{Shiny Apps website}.* You just need to do the following:
  - Sign up (you can use Github account)
  - Get credentials (key and secret)
  - Authorize credentials
  - Package app in appropriate format
  - Deploy

* Free accounts are limited to 5 apps and 25 active hours a month. You will need to ensure you do not exceed these limits.

# Developing Shiny applications in R
## Information on example files
- `app.R` is an example of simple Shiny app to interactively plot correlations, along with other descriptive statistics
- `app2.R` modifies the previous app to use the `shinydashboards` framework
- `/app` is a directory containing two files, `ui.R` and `server.R` (the components of `app.R`)
  - `test.R` uses the files in `/app` to launch a local version of the app
  - `app_deploy_template.R` can be run to deploy the app to shinyapps.io.
    - You must add credentials and other information to this template before running it.
