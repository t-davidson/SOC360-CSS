# Plan
1. Course updates
2. Final projects
3. Developing Shiny applications in R

# Course updates
- Homework 2 released after class
  - Github Classroom link in Canvas Module
  - Topics: tidyverse + ggplot2, APIs, and webscraping
  - Deadline: Next Wednesday, 10/16, 11:59pm ET

# Final projects
## Goals
- Build an interactive data visualization app, focused on a topic of social scientific interest
- Showcase skills and knowledge developed in this class
- Add to your portfolio or resume

# Final projects
## Five steps
1. Data collection
2. Data cleaning
3. Data analysis
4. Data visualization
5. Building and deploying an app

# Final projects
## Data collection
- Collect a dataset related to social science
- Data sources:
    - APIs
    - Webscraping
    - Existing datasets (e.g. General Social Survey, American National Election Study)

# Final projects
## Data cleaning
- Process dataset to extract relevant data
  - String pre-processing (more next week)
  - Parsing HTML
  - Merging datasets
  - Selecting, grouping, mutating, etc.
  
# Final projects
## Data analysis
- Conduct an analysis of the dataset. Possibilities include
  - Data summaries
  - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.)
  - Statistical tests (correlation, t-test, chi-squared, etc.)
  - Statistical modeling (regression, machine learning, topic modeling, etc.)

# Final projects
## Data visualization
- Construct visualizations of the dataset
  - Relationships between variables
  - Trends over time
  - Animations
  - Maps
- *All apps must have an interactive component*

# Final projects
## Building and deploying an app
- Use R Shiny to build an interactive app
- Deploy the app on the web using `Shinyapps.io`

# Final projects
## Final deliverables
1. A deployed Shiny app for interactive data visualization
2. An organized Github repository for the project
3. Documentation and a short written description of the app

# Final projects
## Milestones
1. Identify a suitable topic
  - *All projects are subject to approval*
2. Initial proposal (due 10/23)
  - A short description of the planned project including plan for data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization
3. Prototype (due 11/20)
  - A basic working prototype of your app
4. Presentation (12/9 & 12/11)
  - Short demo and discussion in class
5. App and deliverables submitted (12/13 at 5pm)

# Final projects
## Feedback
- There will be several opportunities for formal and informal feedback
  - Office hours
  - Discussions with classmates
  - Feedback on proposal and prototype
  - Presentation
  
# Final projects
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="70%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/agile_workflow.png')
```
  
# Final projects
## Teams
- You will work as part of a team (3-4 students)
- Teams will be require to submit a document describing contributions of each member
  - Ensure fair distribution of work

# Developing Shiny applications in R
## What is Shiny?
- Shiny is a package you can use to build interactive web pages directly from R
  - It does not require any experience with HTML, CSS, or Javascript, etc.
- Apps can be hosted on standalone webpages, enabling anyone to access them
- Many extensions available, making Shiny a powerful tool for data visualization and construction of dashboards.

# Developing Shiny applications in R
## Example 1: Explore your weather
- A \href{https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/start-simple/faithful/}{simple app} to show data on eruptions of Old Faithful, a geyer in Yellowstone NP

# Developing Shiny applications in R
## Example 2: Bloodbanks in India
- \href{https://opndt.shinyapps.io/bloodbank_india/}{This app} maps bloodbanks in India using data from the Open Government Platform
- Interactive, clickable map
- Tabs to show raw data and provide further details

# Developing Shiny applications in R
## More examples
- There are many more examples in the \href{https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/}{Gallery} on the Shiny website.

# Developing Shiny applications in R
## Extensions
- There are many extensions of the Shiny framework
  - \href{https://d3js.org/}{D3} for data-driven visualization. See \href{https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/articles/shiny.html}{`r2d3` website}
  - \href{https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/shiny.html}{Leaflet for interactive mapping}
  - \href{https://plotly-r.com/}{Plotly for interactive plots}
- \href{https://github.com/nanxstats/awesome-shiny-extensions}{This Github page} lists a ton of Shiny resources.

# Developing Shiny applications in R
## Further readings
- RStudio's \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/shiny.pdf}{Shiny cheatsheet} is a really useful quick reference.
- *\href{https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html}{Mastering Shiny}* by Hadley Wickham is available for free online.
- RStudio has a \href{https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/}{tutorial}.
- Lots of videos on YouTube

# Developing Shiny applications in R
## Deployment
- Apps can be deployed for free using the \href{https://www.shinyapps.io/}{Shiny Apps website}.* You just need to do the following:
  - Sign up (you can use Github account)
  - Link to RStudio using credentials
  - Package app in appropriate format
  - Deploy

* Free accounts are limited to 5 apps and 25 active hours a month. You will need to ensure you do not exceed these limits.

# Developing Shiny applications in R
## Information on example files
1. `app.R` is an example of simple Shiny app to interactively plot correlations, along with other descriptive statistics
2. `app2.R` modifies the previous app to use the `shinydashboards` framework
3. `https://github.com/t-davidson/soc360-project` is a Github repository with a demo of an app that uses additional data.
    - This can serve as a model for your projects
