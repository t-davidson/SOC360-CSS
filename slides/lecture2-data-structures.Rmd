# Social networks
- A social network is a set of actors, or people, and the relationships between them
    - Family structures and kinship networks
    - Friendship and acquaintanceship networks
    - Organizations
    - Online social networks
    
# Social network analysis   
- Social network analysis is the study of social networks using mathematical and computational tools
- Networks can be represented using concepts from a branch of mathematics called graph theory
    - People or actors are represented as "nodes"
    - Relationships are represented as "edges"

# Social network analysis 
- Social scientists use these representations to study the structure and dynamics of social networks
    - What does the network look like?
    - What are the patterns of connectivity?
    - How does information flow through the network?
    - How does the network change over time?

# Part II: Data structures

Open RStudio and load `lecture2-data-structures.Rmd`, located in this week's Canvas Module.

# Basic types
There are four basic types we will be using throughout the class. Here I used them to record some information about one of my cats. In R, it is convention to use the `<-` operator to assign an object to a name.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize'}
# Character (also known as "strings")
name <- "Gary"
# Numeric
weight <- 13.2
# Integer ("int" for short)
age <- 7L
# Logical
human <- FALSE
```
\tiny The other two are called `complex` and `raw`. See \href{https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-lang.html}{documentation}

# Basic types
There are a few useful commands for inspecting objects.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
print(name) # Prints value in console
class(name) # Shows class of object
typeof(name) # Shows type of object, not always equal to class
```

# Basic types
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
print(weight) # Prints value in console
class(weight) # Shows class of object
typeof(weight) # Shows type of object, not always equal to class
```

# Basic types
We can use the `==` expression to verify the value of an object. We will discuss Boolean operations in more detail next lecture.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
name == "Tabitha"
age == 4L
age >= 4L # is greater than
age != 4L # is not
```

# Vectors
A vector is a collection of elements of the *same* type. We can define an empty vector with `N` elements of a type. Empty vectors assume certain default values depending on the type.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
N <- 5
x <- logical(N)
print(x)
y <- numeric(N)
print(y)
z <- character(N)
print(z)
```

# Vectors
Let's take a closer look at numeric vectors. We can use the combine function `c()` to concatenate multiple values into a vector.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
v1 <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
v2 <- c(1,1,1,1,1)
class(v1) # check the class of v1
```

# Vectors
We can easily perform various mathematical operations on numeric vectors
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
v1 + v2 # addition
v1 - v2 # subtraction
v1 * v2 # multiplication
sum(v1) # sum over v1
```
\tiny Note how the different methods return different types of outputs. The arithmetic operations return vectors while `sum` returns a numeric value.


# Vectors
What happens if we try to combine objects of different types using combine?
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
t <- c("a", 1, TRUE)
typeof(t)
t
```

# Vectors
There are lots of commands for generating special types of numeric vectors. Note how `N` has already been defined above.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
seq(N) # generates a sequence from 1 to N
rev(seq(N)) # reverses order
rnorm(N) # samples N times from a normal distribution
```

# Vectors
We can use the help `?` command to find information about each of these commands.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
?seq
```

# Vectors
We can use the `index` to access the specific elements of a vector. R uses square brackets for such indexing.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
x <- rnorm(N)
print(x)
print(x[1]) # R indexing starts at 1; Python and some others start at 0

x[1] <- 9 # We can combine indexing with assignment to modify elements
print(x)
```

# Vectors
The `head` and `tail` commands are useful when we're working with larger objects. Here we draw 10,000 observations from an normal distribution.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
x <- rnorm(10000)
length(x)
head(x)
tail(x)
```

# Excercise: Vectors
Retrieve the final element from `x` using indexing.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }

```


# Vectors
Vectors can also contain null elements to indicate missing values, represented by the `NA` symbol.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
x <- c(1,2,3,4,NA)
is.na(x) # The is.na function indicates whether each value is missing.
!is.na(x) # Prepending ! denotes the inverse of a logical operation
```
\tiny `NA` is a logical type but can exist within numeric and character vectors. It is an exception to the rule discussed above regarding the presence of multiple types in the same vector.

# Lists
A list is an object that can contain different types of elements, including basic types and vectors.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
print(v1)
l1 <- list(v1) # We can easily convert the vector v1 into a list.
print(l1)
```

# Lists
Lists have a slightly different form of indexing. This can be one of the most confusing aspects of R for beginners!
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
l1[1] # The first element of the list contains the vector
l1[[1]] # Double brackets allows us to access the vector itself
class(l1[1]) # first element is a list
class(l1[[1]]) # double indexing gives us the contents
```

# Lists
We can access specific elements of a list by using standard indexing.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
l1[[1]][1] # Followed by single brackets to access a specific element
l1[1][1] # If we're not careful, we will just get the entire sublist
```

# Lists
We can easily combine multiple vectors into a list.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
v.list <- list(v1,v2) # We could store both vectors in a list
print(v.list)
v.list[[2]][4] # We can use double brackets to get element 4 of list 1
```

# Lists
We index sublists using double brackets, then specific elements with single brackets.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
v.list[[1]][4] # We can use double brackets to get element 4 of list 1
```

# Lists
We can make indexing easier if we start with an empty list and then add elements using a named index via the `$` operator.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
v <- list() # initialize empty list
v$v1 <- v1 # the $ sign is used for named indexing
v$v2 <- v2
print(v)
```

# Excercise: Lists
Combine `$` and square bracket indexing to extract the 5th element of `v1` from the list `v`.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=F, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }

```


# Lists
We can define lists more concisely by providing sublists as named arguments.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
cats <- list(names = c("Gary", "Tabitha"), ages = c(5,2))
print(cats)
```

# Matrices
A matrix is a two-dimensional data structure. Like vectors, matrices hold objects of a single type. Here we're defining a matrix using two arguments, the number of rows and columns.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
matrix(nrow=5,ncol=5) # Here there is no content so the matrix is empty
```

# Matrices
We can also pass an argument to define the initial contents of a matrix.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
M <- matrix(0L, nrow=5, ncol=5) # 5x5 matrix of zeros
M
```

# Matrices
We can create a matrix by combining vectors using `cbind`.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
M1 <- cbind(v1,v2) # Treat vectors a columns
print(M1)
```

# Matrices
If we want to treat the vectors as rows, we alternatively use `rbind`. We could also get the same result by *transposing* `M1`.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
M2 <- rbind(v1, v2) # Vectors as rows
print(M2)
print(t(M1)) # t() is the transpose function
```

# Matrices
The `dim` function provides us with information about the dimensions of a given matrix. It returns the number of rows and columns.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
dim(M1) # Shows the dimensions of the matrix
dim(M2)
```

# Matrices
We can get particular values using two-dimensional indexing. By convention `i` denotes the row and `j` the column.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
i <- 1 # row index
j <- 2 # column index
M1[i,j] # Returns element i,j
M1[i,] # Returns row i
M1[,j] # Returns column i
```

# Matrices
Like lists, we can  also name rows and columns to help make indexing easier. The `colnames` and `rownames` functions show the names of each column and row.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
colnames(M1)
rownames(M1)
```

# Matrices
We can use these functions to assign new names.
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
colnames(M1) <- c("X", "Y")
rownames(M1) <- seq(1, nrow(M1))
print(M1)
```

# Putting it all together
## Storing names in vectors
Let's see how these types of objects can be used to create formal representations of social networks. We can start by defining a vector of names for a fictional friend group.

```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
names <- c("Jay", "Amy", "Pete", "Mia")
```

# Putting it all together
## Representing relationships in a matrix
Next, we can define a matrix to store relationship ties. Each person is referenced according to their index in the name vector

```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
X <- matrix(0, nrow = length(names), ncol = length(names))
X[1,2] <- 1 # edge from Jay to Amy.
X[1,3] <- 1
X[3,2] <- 1
X[1,4] <- 1
X[4,2] <- 1

print(X)
```

# Putting it all together
## Storing information in a list
```{r, echo=TRUE, , mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize' }
network_info <- list(names = names, network = X)
print(network_info)
```  

# Putting it all together
## Plotting the network
```{r, echo=FALSE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize', out.width="70%",out.height="70%", fig.align="center"}
require("igraph")
require("ggnetwork")
require("ggplot2")

g <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(X, mode = "directed", diag = F)
V(g)$name <- names
net <- ggnetwork(g)
ggplot(net, aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  geom_edges(color = "black", arrow = arrow(type = "closed", length = unit(2, "mm"))) +
  geom_nodes(color = "black", size = 6) +
  geom_nodelabel_repel(aes(label = name),
                       fontface = "bold", box.padding = unit(1, "lines")) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  xlim(min(net$x) - 0.2, max(net$x) + 0.2) +  # Adjusting x limits
  ylim(min(net$y) - 0.2, max(net$y) + 0.2)   # Adjusting y limits
```
