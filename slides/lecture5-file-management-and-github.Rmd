# File management
- File management in this class
    - Keeping track of course materials
    - Working on homework assignments
    - Organizing final projects
    - Reproducibility!

# Organizing your files
- Make a directory to contain all materials for this class
- Store this somewhere practical
    - e.g, `/Users/me/Documents/SOC360`, `/Users/me/Desktop/Classes/SOC360`
    - Do not just leave files in your `Downloads` directory!

# Organizing your files
- Within this directory, make a separate directory for the class materials, readings, and homework assignments. It might look something like this.
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/directory_structure.png')
```
        
# Github
- Github is a version-control system
    - This allows you to easily control and manage changes to your code (similar to Track Changes in Word)
    - It can facilitate collaboration
    - Version-control helps to ensure reproducibility
    - It makes it easy to share code
- Github is *not* designed as a place to store large datasets (100Mb file size limit)

# Terminology
- A Github *repository* (or *repo* for short) contains all files and associated history
    - A repository can be public or private
    - Files should be organized into folders
    - Github can render Markdown files (suffix ``.md`` in Markdown), useful for documentation
- Github repositories exist online and you can *clone* them to your local computer

# Using Github
- You can interact with Github in several different ways:
    - RStudio integration (recommended)
    - Github Desktop (redundant if using RStudio)
    - Through your browser (not recommended, but viewing is fine)
    - Using the command line (recommended for advanced users)

# Using Github
Follow the instructions on the course website to set up Github with RStudio: \url{https://github.com/t-davidson/SOC360-CSS/}

1. Register for a Github account
2. Install Git
3. Sync your Github account with RStudio
  
# Cloning the course materials
- Once you have this set up, navigate to the course website on Github and copy the URL:
    - \url{https://github.com/t-davidson/SOC360-CSS}
  
# Cloning the course materials
- In RStudio, click `File > New Project > Version Control > Git`
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/add_course_github.png')
```

# Cloning the course materials

- Paste the URL into the `Repository URL` field
- Write a suitable name in the `Project directory name` field
    - This will be the name of the folder that is created on your computer
- Choose a location to store the repository on your computer
    - Recommend using the folder we created earlier
- Then click `Create Project`

# Cloning the course materials
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/github_loading.png')
```

# Cloning the course materials
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/updated_file_structure.png')
```

# Cloning the course materials
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/inside_the_directory.png')
```

# Navigating files using RStudio
You can also use the `Files` pane in RStudio to navigate folders.
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/cd_point_and_click_1.png')
```

# Opening this .Rmd file
- Navigate to `slides/` and open `lecture5-file-management-and-github.Rmd` by double-clicking the file

# Navigating files using RStudio
Run the `getwd()` command to show the current working directory in R. 
```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=F, tidy=TRUE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize'}
getwd()
```

# Navigating files using RStudio
Run the `setwd()` command to change your working directory. Try going one step back from the current directory using `..`. You can then run `getwd()` to verify it has changed.
```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=F, tidy=TRUE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize', warning=F}
setwd("..")
getwd()
```

# Navigating files using RStudio
- When a `.Rmd` file is opened RStudio defaults to the directory where the file is contained.
    - If you run `setwd()` it will change within a chunk, but other chunks will revert back to the working directory.
    
# Navigating files using RStudio
The working directory is important when considering loading files. Navigate to the `code` directory. You can use the `list.files` function to see a list of the files in the current directory.
```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=F, tidy=TRUE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize'}
setwd("../code/")
list.files()
```
    
# Using file paths
- The working directory is critical because it defines a path we need to use to load files. Different files will fall into one of three groups:
    1. File contained in the working directory.
    2. Files contained in outer directories.
    3. Files contained in inner, nested directories.
    
# Files contained in the working directory
If a file exists in the working directory, you will see it when running `list.files`. It can be loaded by using the file name.
```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=F, tidy=TRUE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize', message=F}
library("tidyverse")
read_file("file.txt") %>% print()
```  

# Files contained in an outer directory
If a file is contained in an upper level directory, you need to use the `..` to escape the current directory. For each step out from the current directory you need to add another `/..` to the file path. In this case, the file is contained one level above the current directory.
```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=F, tidy=TRUE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize'}
read_file("../file_outer.txt") %>% print()
```  

# Files contained in an inner directory
If a file is contained in an inner directory, you need to add the name of the directory to the file path.
```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=F, tidy=TRUE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize'}
read_file("nested/file_nested.txt") %>% print()
```  

# Files contained in an inner directory
If a file is contained in an inner directory, you need to add the name of the directory to the file path.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=F, tidy=TRUE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize'}
read_file("nested/nested2/file_nested2.txt") %>% print()
```  

# Exercise
Modify the path below to find and print the contents of the hidden file in the course repository.
```{r, echo=T, eval=F, tidy=TRUE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize'}
read_file("") %>% print()
```  

# File navigation
## Common errors
- It is common to get errors if you misspecify a path when trying to load a file. You will get an error like the following:
    - `Error: 'filename' does not exist in the current working directory ('directory').`
- If this happens, check whether the file is in your current working directory.
    - You can always use your `Files` tab or your normal file viewer to verify the location.

# Homework 1
## Github classroom
- Homework 1 released on Github Classroom

        - Select your Rutgers NetID
        - This will take you to a Github repository
        
# Homework 1
## Cloning the repository
- Clone the repository using the same process as above and store within the class folder
    - Copy the URL
    - Start a new project and paste the URL
    - Store it somewhere sensible
        - DO NOT store this inside the repository for the course materials
