# File management
- Organizing the class materials
- Navigating files using RStudio

# Organizing your files
- Make a directory to contain all materials for this class
- Store this somewhere practical
    - e.g, `/Users/me/Documents/SOC360`, `/Users/me/Desktop/Classes/SOC360`
    - Do not just leave files in your `Downloads` directory!

# Organizing your files
- Within this directory, make a separate directory for the class materials, readings, and homework assignments. It might look something like this.
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/directory_structure.png')
```
        
# Github
- Github is a version-control system
    - This allows you to easily control and manage changes to your code (similar to Track Changes in Word)
    - It can facilitate collaboration
    - Version-control helps to ensure reproducibility
    - It makes it easy to share code
- Github is *not* designed as a place to store large datasets (100Mb file size limit)

# Terminology
- A Github *repository* (or *repo* for short) contains all files and associated history
    - A repository can be public or private
    - Files should be organized into folders
    - Github can render Markdown files (suffix ``.md`` in Markdown), useful for documentation
- Github repositories exist online and you can *clone* them to your local computer

# Using Github
- You can interact with Github in several different ways
  - Github Desktop (recommended)
  - Through your browser (not recommended)
  - Using the command line
  - RStudio integration
    - See https://happygitwithr.com/index.html for a guide

# Install Github Desktop
- Install Github Desktop by using this link: https://desktop.github.com/

# Using Github Desktop
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/github_desktop1.png')
```

# Using Github Desktop
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/github_desktop2.png')
```

# Using Github Desktop
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/github_desktop3.png')
```

# Using Github Desktop
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/files_after_github.png')
```

# Opening this .Rmd file
- Navigate the repository you just created and open this .Rmd file.
- The file will be located in the following *path*:
    - `~/SOC360/css-spring-2022/slides/lecture5-file-management-and-github.Rmd`
        - The `~` stands in for the location of the `SOC360` directory on your computer. 

# Navigating files using RStudio
Run the `getwd()` command to show the current working directory in R. 
```{r, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize'}
getwd()
```

# Navigating files using RStudio
Run the `setwd()` command to change your working directory. You can then run `getwd()` to verify it has changed.
```{r, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize'}
setwd("/Users/davidson/Desktop/")
getwd()
```

# Navigating files using RStudio
- RMarkdown defaults to the directory where the `.Rmd` file is contained.
    - If you run `setwd()` it will change within a chunk, but other chunks will revert back to the working directory.
    
# Navigating files using RStudio
You can also use the `Files` pane in RStudio to navigate folders and set a working directory.
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/rstudio_file_viewer.png')
```

    
# Navigating files using RStudio
The working directory is important when considering loading files. You can use the `list.files` function to see a list of the files in the current directory.
```{r, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize'}
setwd("/Users/davidson/Desktop/Classes/css-spring-2022/")
list.files()
```
    
# Using file paths
- The working directory is important because it defines a path we need to use to load files. Different files will fall into one of three groups:
    - File contained in the working directory.
    - Files contained in outer directories.
    - Files contained in inner, nested directories.
    
# Files contained in the working directory
If a file exists in the working directory, you will see it when running `list.files`. It can be loaded by using the file name.
```{r, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize'}
library("tidyverse")
f <- read_file("file.txt")
print(f)
```  

# Files contained in an outer directory
If a file is contained in an upper level directory, you need to use the `..` to escape the current directory. For each step out from the current directory you need to add another `/..` to the file path. In this case, the file is contained one level above the current directory.
```{r, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize'}
f <- read_file("../file_outer.txt")
print(f)
```  

# Files contained in an inner directory
If a file is contained in an inner directory, you need to add the name of the directory to the file path.
```{r, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize'}
f <- read_file("nested/file_nested.txt")
print(f)
```  

# Files contained in an inner directory
If a file is contained in an inner directory, you need to add the name of the directory to the file path.
```{r, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize'}
f <- read_file("nested/nested2/file_nested2.txt")
print(f)
```  

# Errors
- It is common to get errors if you misspecify a path when trying to load a file. You will get an error like the following:
    - `Error: 'filename' does not exist in the current working directory ('directory').`
- If this happens, check whether the file is in your current working directory.
    - You can always use your `Files` tab or your normal file viewer to verify the location.

# Making a new Github repository
Go to Github and click the `New` button in the top-left corner.
```{r, out.width="40%",out.height="30%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/gitnew.png')
```  

# Making a new Github repository
Give the repository and informative name.
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/gitnew2.png')
```  

# Making a new Github repository
Check the `Add .gitignore` box and select `R` from the dropdown. This will prevent unnecessary files from being committed (more later).
```{r, out.width="40%",out.height="30%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/gitnew3.png')
``` 

# Making a new Github repository
When you're ready, click `Create repository`.
```{r, out.width="40%",out.height="30%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/gitnew4.png')
``` 

# Making a new Github repository
You will be taken to the Github page for your repository.
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/gitnew5.png')
``` 

# Cloning a new repository
- You can `clone` this repository to your computer by copying the URL at the top, e.g. `https://github.com/t-davidson/test-repository`
- Cloning creates a local version of the repository.

# Cloning a new repository
Go to Github Desktop and click the `Add` dropdown and select `Clone Repository...`
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/clone_new.png')
``` 

# Cloning a new repository
Paste the URL into the relevant box and select the path. In this case, the repository will be contained within the `SOC360` folder.
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/clone_new2.png')
``` 


# Editing the repository
- Navigate to the directory and open the `README.md` file
- Add some new text to this file
- Return to Github Desktop


# Committing a change
You can see the file has changed. Click `Commit to main` to prepare to update the online version using a *commit*.
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/push1.png')
``` 

# Committing a change
You will now see that there are `no uncommitted changes`.
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/push2.png')
``` 

# Pushing a change
Finally, click `Push origin` to *push* the changes
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/push3.png')
``` 

# Verifying the update
Refresh the Github page in your browser. You should now be able to see the update.
```{r, out.width="70%",out.height="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/push4.png')
```

# Pulling changes
- Just like you use `push` to send your changes  from your computer to the internet, you need to use `pull` to bring changes from the internet to the local version.
- Before each lecture, navigate to the class Github repository and click `Fetch origin`. This will allow you to download the new slides and other files.
```{r, out.width="40%",out.height="30%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('../images/fetch.png')
```


# Github in the command line
- Let's say you want to make changes to a repository, in this case adding a single file called ``myfile.txt``:
 -  Make changes to ``myfile.txt`` and save the file.
 - ``git status`` will show information about the status of your repo.
 - ``git add myfile.txt`` will stage the file to be added to the online repo.
    - Avoid using ``git add *`` (only check files you want in Github Desktop)
 - ``git commit -m "Adding a new file"`` commits the file to the repo, along with an informative message.

# Github in the command line
- ``git push origin main`` then tells Github to push the local changes to the main branch of the online repository
    - Conversely, ``git pull origin main`` will pull the latest updates from your main branch to your local machine
- Now visit the web page for your repository and you should see the changes.


# Github Classroom and homework assignments
- We will be using *Github Classroom* for the homework assignments
  - You will each have template repository containing the homework
  - Clone this repository using Github Desktop
  - Submit your homework by pushing your updates
- Full instructions are contained in the repository

# Github Student Developer Pack
- If you haven't already, log in and apply for the Github Student Developer pack
  - https://education.github.com/pack
- This allows you to make unlimited private repositories and gives access to many other tools

# Next week
- Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
- Collecting and analyzing data from Spotify and other platforms
    

# Advanced Github
## Branches and merging
- A *branch* consists of a particular version of the repo
    - All repos start with a single branch called *main* (formerly *master*)
    - You can create separate branches for particular tasks
        - This is particularly useful for collaboration
    - You can then *merge* the branch back into main
        - But be careful of *merge conflicts*
- A *pull request* is a mechanism for merging content into a repository
    - This can enable the code to be reviewed before it is integrated
- The *issue* function can be used to note any issues with the code and to bring them to the repo owner's attention (e.g. https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2)

# Advanced Github
## Forks
- A *fork* is a copy of another repository (usually from another user)
    - This allows you to easily copy the repository and modify it without changing the original content
